JSON: JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It's a lightweight data format that's
easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.

Advantages of Using JWT:

1. Stateless: The server doesn't need to keep a session store as the JWT itself contains the user state.
2. Scalable: Easier to scale across servers because no session information is stored on the server.
3. Compact: Because they are JSON-based, JWTs are compact and can be sent via URL, POST parameter, or inside an HTTP header.
4. Self-contained: The token contains all the information needed for authentication, including user permissions and expiry information.

# Ping is a fundamental network administration command used to test and verify connectivity between devices on an Internet Protocol (IP) network.

1. It’s like saying, “Hey, are you there?” and waiting for a response.
2. The name “ping” comes from sonar technology, where pulses of sound are sent out and then echoed back.
3. computer network is collection of interconnected network and devices and that communicate each others.

      mutable: a variable can change whole items so we can called  mutables. 
  
  function sum(num1, num2){
    return num1 + num2;
  };
  console.log(sum(2, 5));

  var suppressWarning = false;
  function setSuppressWarning(newSuppressWarning) {
    {
      suppressWarning = newSuppressWarning;
    }
    Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.

  This code assigns many values (Fiat, 500, white) to an object named car:
  const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};
