JSON: JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It's a lightweight data format that's easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.
Advantages of Using JWT:
1. Stateless: The server doesn't need to keep a session store as the JWT itself contains the user state.
2. Scalable: Easier to scale across servers because no session information is stored on the server.
3. Compact: Because they are JSON-based, JWTs are compact and can be sent via URL, POST parameter, or inside an HTTP header.
4. Self-contained: The token contains all the information needed for authentication, including user permissions and expiry information.
