JSON: JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It's a lightweight data format that's
easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.

Advantages of Using JWT:

import{useState}from "react";
new state

git commit -m ""

compress our file
root.render(<JsxHead />);

dev dependesice
game()
shiwft
forin

axios()
for of()
for in()

const logo = () =>{
  return (
   <h2>
   <img alt ="" src="" className = ""/>
   <restaurentCard key ={index} ; 
   import {useState} from "react";
   )
  }

   what is promises?
   closuers?
stack is data storage.
 
   ^ caret
   ~ tilde
</h2>
);
}

[Array join property is the most use full function for using , - _ these types of activity]

1. Stateless: The server doesn't need to keep a session store as the JWT itself contains the user state.
2. Scalable: Easier to scale across servers because no session information is stored on the server.
3. Compact: Because they are JSON-based, JWTs are compact and can be sent via URL, POST parameter, or inside an HTTP header.
4. Self-contained: The token contains all the information needed for authentication, including user permissions and expiry information.

Ping is a fundamental network administration command used to test and verify connectivity between devices on an Internet Protocol (IP) network.
It’s like saying, “Hey, are you there?” and waiting for a response.
The name “ping” comes from sonar technology, where pulses of sound are sent out and then echoed back.
