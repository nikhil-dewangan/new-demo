JSON: JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It's a lightweight data format that's       
easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.

Advantages of Using JWT:                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                               
1. Pre-Decrement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
2. Post-Decrement.                                                                                                                                                                                                
   ( {props} )                                                                                                                                                                                                 
1. add commit -m.                                                                                                                                           
2. connection types:                                                                                                                                                
3. Analyze the system.                                                                    
4. testing the program.

Here is two type of decalartion:   

a. Implicit declaration.
b. Explicit declaration.  

const navbar = ({companty)=>{
 npm start
 write your on story.
 
}

Parcel,Bundeler,vite

}

  => Git Hub shorcut:=>
1. point to point
2. multipoint
3. text.indexOf("Locate")
4. document.querySelctor("")
5. shift + f5
6. ctrl + alt up arrow

   what is promises?
   closuers?
   stack is data storage.

[Array join property is the most use full function for using , - _ these types of activity]

1. Stateless: The server doesn't need to keep a session store as the JWT itself contains the user state.
2. Scalable: Easier to scale across servers because no session information is stored on the server.
3. Compact: Because they are JSON-based, JWTs are compact and can be sent via URL, POST parameter, or inside an HTTP header.
4. Self-contained: The token contains all the information needed for authentication, including user permissions and expiry information.

Ping is a fundamental network administration command used to test and verify connectivity between devices on an Internet Protocol (IP) network.
It’s like saying, “Hey, are you there?” and waiting for a response.
The name “ping” comes from sonar technology, where pulses of sound are sent out and then echoed back.

ctreate elements take three arguments.
const HeadArr = ()=>(
<p> lorem to win and how  are you doing and we use </p>
</Title>
<Title></Title>
const RestaurentCard = ({resNmae, cusinss}) =>{
<h3>{resName}</h3>
<Restaurent res-add ="Bhilai"
   cusins ="pizza, burger"/>

)
